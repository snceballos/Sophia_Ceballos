Python is one of the simpler languages in terms of coding for me so it was easy to pick up for the assignments. I did have some issues with the questions but the videos given does help. 

For quesiton 1, I first defined what my starting row/column and target row/columm are. Then I defined the distance and made sure that the thing moving only goes to 1. I then created a while loop to have the matrix working as i made an if else statement to have the piece move around the array.

For question 2, I started by adding the code given to my program. Then I created the minCost needed for the binary tree. THen I created the binary tree needed.

For question 3, I created a new node, and I inserted the nod einto a binary tree. I created a code to put the function in a BTS format. Then I made an if/else statement to make sure if it goes null it returns, if its a leaf node it will print, i right or left child exists it will be check recursively/ Then I added the driver code for the leaf node.

For Question 4, after reading the chapter I was able to answer this. It was a pretty simple task since I was also able to look up Tarry's rule and the depth-first search algorithm to have a better understanding of the problem, but I believe I answered it to the best of my ability.
